I'm guessing you play Lethal Company to get ads, so this will increase the nmber of ads introduced in v70.

This is currently mostly a proof of concept while I work on things.
It currently allows ads even when solo or the last one alive, unlike in vanilla, sets the time to display at the minimum value, and makes the ads pop up every 30 seconds.

## TODO

- Make time to start still be randomized, just more often.
- Make ad chosen more random, currently replays the lowest discount every time.
- Ad configs
- But what if custom ads?
